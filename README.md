## Course Description

Automated testing relies on scripting and frameworks like Selenium to prove that products work as expected. Test automation is an enormous time-saver, and it's crucial to continuous integration, continuous delivery, and agile software development. If you're employed in QA, DevOps, or IT, you need to know the basics. This course covers the foundations of test automation, as well as different strategies for implementation. Meaghan explains what kinds of tests to use, how to choose the right test tools, and how to plan and execute test automation projects. She also describes strategies to maintain automation over time: adding new tests, updating old tests, and resolving failures.

## About this repository

This repository hosts the code for an application called AI Animal Art. This is an application built with [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), a web framework for Node.js.

There are tests for the application written in the tests folder. There are three different types of tests: unit, integration, and UI.

##  Instructions

### Run the test application

To run the test application and use it in a browser, complete the following steps:

1. Start a new Codespaces instance by going to the Code dropdown, selecting the Codespaces tab, and then Selecting the `+` button to create a new codespace on the main branch.
1. Once the codespace is setup, open the terminal.
1. In the terminal, type `npm install` and press enter to install all dependencies.
1. Next type `npm start` to start the local server.
1. The server starts up at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Navigate to that URL, or select **Open in Browser** in the pop-up that appears once the server is running.
1. Explore the test application.
